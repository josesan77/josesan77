Hi there! 👋

I'm Jozsef Orban, a passionate software developer with a focus on Data Science and applications of AI.

🔭 I’m currently working on an Automated ETL (extract-transfer-load) software based on Python3 to prepare and clean data for a Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. I am also extracting data from the connected database of the system by a Business Intelligence (BI) software using SQL queries (run on Firebird database). 

🌱 I’m currently and continuously learning AI & ML methods, developing my Python knowledge.

💬 Ask me about Image and data analysis, visualization, SQL, Python or related topics. I will do my best to give you an answer.

📫 How to reach me: josesan77 @ gmail. com

🛠️ Languages and Tools: Python3 is the most handy for me, but in the previous years I used Java, PHP and also HTML5 and CSS.
I use Anaconda Spider as IDE in case of python coding, and NetBeans or IntelliJ Idea for Java, EclipsPHP for PHP, but as ultimate tool I prefer Notepad++ with the appropriate plugins.
I have some experience in automation (of software clicking :) ) with Autohotkey.
